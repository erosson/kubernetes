* nginx-ingress isn't in git yet
* cert-manager isn't in git yet. kubectl apply -f https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.11.0/cert-manager.yaml ; https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/
* removing letsencrypt from hello1 didn't work
* easier dashboard access would be really nice
    * didn't we install a dashboard on our cluster? `kubectl proxy` accesses it, which is safe enough. how to preload auth? how to get a sane url?
* how do secrets work? (private subrepo? public sealed files?)
* test-letsencrypt-cfproxy is busted. I'd like full encryption though! is it safe to enable full encryption for our whole domain?
